# Data-Science-Practice
A place for organize my Data Science projects! 


In this lab exercise, you will learn a popular machine learning algorithm, Decision Trees. 
You will use this classification algorithm to build a model from the historical data of patients, and their response to different medications. 
Then you will use the trained decision tree to predict the class of a unknown patient, or to find a proper drug for a new patient.
